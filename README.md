# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Description

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a web application enhancement focused on updating the sales report by adding a dynamic table that displays each product alongside its corresponding sales amount. The sales data is sourced from a CSV file (`sales.csv`), and the application ensures the total sales amount remains accurate and up-to-date.

---

## Features

- Dynamically generates a sales table with product names and their sales amounts.
- Adds a table with the ID `#sales-table` containing a header row (`Product`, `Sales`).
- Reads sales data from `sales.csv`.
- Maintains the accuracy of the total sales displayed in the `#total-sales` element.
- Clean and user-friendly presentation of sales data.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
   - A local server environment (optional but recommended for loading CSV files due to browser security restrictions).

2. **Project Files:**
   - `index.html` (or relevant HTML file with `#sales-table` and `#total-sales` elements).
   - `sales.csv` (CSV file containing product sales data).
   - JavaScript and CSS files as included in the project.

3. **Running Locally:**
   - Clone or download the project repository.
   - Ensure `sales.csv` is located in the root or appropriate directory accessible by the web app.
   - Use a local server to serve the files:
     - Using Python 3:  
       ```bash
       python -m http.server 8000
       ```
     - Using VSCode Live Server extension or any other static server.
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or your respective port).

## Usage Guide

1. **Viewing Sales Report:**
   - Open the web application in your browser.
   - The sales report table (`#sales-table`) will be automatically populated with products and their sales amounts from `sales.csv`.
   - The total sales value displayed in the element `#total-sales` will reflect the sum of all sales accurately.

2. **Updating Sales Data:**
   - Modify the `sales.csv` file with updated product sales data.
   - Refresh the web page to see the updated report.

## Technical Details

- **Data Source:**  
  Sales data is sourced from a CSV file named `sales.csv`. The CSV format is expected to have two columns: product name and sales amount.

- **Table Structure:**  
  The sales table contains a header row:
  ```
  | Product | Sales |
  ```
  followed by rows for each product and its sales amount.

- **Total Sales Calculation:**  
  The application computes the sum of all sales amounts and updates the `#total-sales` element accordingly to maintain accuracy.

- **Implementation:**  
  Likely utilizes JavaScript (or a framework) to fetch and parse CSV data, dynamically create table rows, and update the DOM elements.

- **HTML IDs:**
  - `#sales-table`: The table element displaying product sales.
  - `#total-sales`: The element showing the aggregated total sales amount.
