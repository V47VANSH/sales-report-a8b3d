# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Description

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a web application enhancement that updates the sales report by adding a dynamic sales table. This table displays each product alongside its corresponding sale amount sourced from a `sales.csv` file. The table is implemented with the ID `#sales-table` and includes a header row with columns for **Product** and **Sales**. Additionally, the element with ID `#total-sales` maintains an accurate total of all sales.

## Features

- Parses `sales.csv` to extract product names and sales amounts.
- Dynamically generates a table with ID `#sales-table` displaying:
  - Product names
  - Corresponding sales amounts
- Includes a header row (**Product**, **Sales**) for clarity.
- Automatically updates and maintains the correctness of the total sales displayed in the `#total-sales` element.
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure.

## Setup Instructions

This project requires a web environment capable of serving static files and reading the `sales.csv` file. Follow these steps to set up:

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.

2. **Ensure the `sales.csv` file** is located in the root directory or a specified accessible path.

3. **Serve the application using a local web server** (recommended) to enable proper file reading. You can use one of the following:

   - Using Python 3:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Using Node.js (http-server):
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port your server is running on) to view the application.

## Usage Guide

1. **Prepare your `sales.csv` file** with the following format (no header required):

   ```
   ProductA,1000
   ProductB,1500.75
   ProductC,2300
   ```

2. **Load the web application** in your browser. The sales report will:

   - Display a table with ID `#sales-table` listing each product and its sales value.
   - Show the total sales amount in the element with the ID `#total-sales`.

3. **Verify the data**:

   - The table's first row is the header (`Product`, `Sales`).
   - Each subsequent row corresponds to a product and its sales from the CSV.
   - The total sales value accurately sums all sales amounts.

## Technical Details

- **HTML Structure**:
  - A table element with ID `#sales-table` to display sales data.
  - An element with ID `#total-sales` showing the total sales amount.

- **Data Source**:
  - `sales.csv` file containing product names and sales amounts in CSV format.

- **Implementation**:
  - JavaScript reads and parses the CSV file asynchronously.
  - Dynamically injects rows into the `#sales-table`.
  - Calculates and updates the total sales in `#total-sales`.
  - Sales figures are rounded or formatted appropriately for display.

- **Dependencies**:
  - No external libraries required; uses vanilla JavaScript.
