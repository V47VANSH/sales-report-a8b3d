# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Overview

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a web application feature enhancement focused on updating the sales report by adding a dynamic sales table. The application reads sales data from a CSV file and displays each product alongside its corresponding sale amount. It ensures the sales table is properly structured and that the total sales amount displayed remains accurate.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Sales Table**: Adds a table with the ID `#sales-table` that lists each product and its sales amount.
- **Structured Table Header**: The table includes a header row with columns `Product` and `Sales`.
- **Accurate Total Sales**: The element with the ID `#total-sales` dynamically reflects the correct sum of all sales.
- **CSV Integration**: Loads sales data from a `sales.csv` file.
- **Responsive and Clear Presentation**: The sales report is easy to read and well-formatted for users.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd sales-report-a8b3d
   ```

2. **Ensure the `sales.csv` file is present** in the root directory or the configured data folder. The CSV file should have at least the following columns:
   - `Product`
   - `Sales`

3. **Dependencies**:  
   If your project uses any dependencies (e.g., for CSV parsing or frontend frameworks), install them accordingly. For example, if using Node.js:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:  
   Follow your environment's standard procedure to launch the app (e.g., opening `index.html` in a browser, starting a local server, etc.).

## Usage Guide

1. **Load the application** in a web browser.

2. The sales report section will automatically:
   - Generate a table (`#sales-table`) displaying each product and its sales.
   - Show a header row with the columns `Product` and `Sales`.
   - Calculate and display the total sales amount in the `#total-sales` element.

3. **Update `sales.csv`** whenever new sales data is available. Refresh the page to see updated results.

## Technical Details

- **Data Source**: `sales.csv` file containing product sales data.
- **Table Generation**: The sales table is constructed dynamically by parsing the CSV file and appending rows to the table element with ID `#sales-table`.
- **Total Sales Calculation**: The total sales value is computed by summing all individual sales amounts and updating the `#total-sales` DOM element.
- **Front-End Technologies**: Typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to implement this feature.
- **CSV Parsing**: Depending on implementation, CSV parsing might be handled by a JavaScript library (e.g., PapaParse) or custom parsing code.
