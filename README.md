A simple single-page web application that processes a CSV file named `sales.csv`, calculates the sum of the `sales` column, and displays the total on the page.

## Features

- **Automatic Summation:** Calculates and displays the total of the `sales` column.
- **Responsive UI:** Displays the result in a clearly marked section (`#total-sales`).
- **User Friendly:** Simple interface with clear instructions.
- **Standards Compliant:** Page title is set to "Sales Summary".

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-report-a8b3d.git
   ```
   or download and extract the ZIP.

2. **No Build Required**
   - This project is a static HTML/JS/CSS site. No installations or dependencies are necessary.

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage Guide

1. Ensure you have a CSV file named `sales.csv` ready. The file should have a `sales` column, e.g.:

    ```csv
    item,sales
    Widget A,100
    Widget B,200.50
    Widget C,50
    ```

2. On the web page:
    - Locate the file input or upload section.
    - Select and upload your `sales.csv` file.
    - The application will automatically process the file, sum all values in the `sales` column, and display the total in the element with the ID `#total-sales`.

3. The page title will read **Sales Summary**.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **CSV Parsing:** Uses JavaScript's FileReader API and either native CSV parsing or a lightweight library (e.g., [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/)), depending on implementation.
- **Calculation Logic:** Extracts the `sales` column, converts values to numbers, sums them, and rounds as appropriate.
- **Display:** The total sales value is shown in the element with `id="total-sales"`.
