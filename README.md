# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Overview
**sales-report-a8b3d** is a simple, single-page web application designed to process an attached CSV file named `sales.csv`. The application reads the CSV file, calculates the total sum of the values in the `sales` column, and displays the resulting total within the webpage. The page title is set to **Sales Summary** to reflect its purpose.

---

## Features
- Upload and process a CSV file named `sales.csv`.
- Parse the `sales` column to calculate the total sales amount.
- Display the total sales sum dynamically inside the HTML element with the ID `#total-sales`.
- Clean, minimalistic single-page interface with a descriptive title.
- User-friendly and fast client-side processing without the need for a backend.

## Setup Instructions
No special setup is required. This project is a static web application and can be run directly in any modern web browser.

To get started:
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure your CSV file is named `sales.csv` and follows the expected format with a `sales` column.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

---

## Usage Guide
1. Place your `sales.csv` file in the same directory as the web page or use the file picker if implemented.
2. The application will automatically read and process the CSV file.
3. The total sum of the `sales` column will be calculated and displayed inside the element with ID `total-sales`.
4. The page title shown in the browser tab will be **Sales Summary**.

## Technical Details
- **Technology stack**: HTML5, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **CSV parsing**: Implemented via JavaScript (e.g., using `FileReader` API and custom parsing or a lightweight library)
- **DOM Manipulation**: Total sales value is injected into the element with ID `total-sales`
- **Single-page design**: No server-side components required; all logic runs client-side
- **CSV format assumption**: The CSV file must have a header row with a `sales` column containing numeric values.
