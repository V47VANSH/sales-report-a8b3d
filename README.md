# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Overview

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a web application feature update focused on enhancing the sales reporting interface. This update introduces a dynamically generated sales table that displays each product alongside its corresponding sales amount from the `sales.csv` data source. The update ensures that the total sales amount displayed in the `#total-sales` element remains accurate and consistent.

## Features

- Dynamically generates a sales report table with the id `#sales-table`.
- Displays product names and their respective sales amounts in a clear tabular format.
- Includes a header row with columns: **Product** and **Sales**.
- Reads data directly from the `sales.csv` file.
- Maintains the accuracy of the total sales amount shown in the `#total-sales` element.
- Responsive and clean UI integration for seamless user experience.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**  
   Ensure you have a web server environment capable of serving static files and processing any required scripts, depending on your implementation (e.g., Node.js, Python SimpleHTTPServer).

2. **Project Files**  
   - `index.html` (or relevant HTML file containing `#sales-table` and `#total-sales` elements)  
   - `sales.csv` (CSV file containing sales data)  
   - Supporting JavaScript and CSS files as applicable.

3. **CSV File Format**  
   The `sales.csv` file should be structured as follows:  
   ```
   Product,Sales
   Product A,1000
   Product B,2500
   Product C,1750
   ```
   
4. **Run the Application**  
   - Serve the project files on a local or remote web server.  
   - Open the main HTML file in a web browser.

## Usage Guide

1. **Viewing the Sales Report**  
   Upon loading the application page, the sales data from `sales.csv` will be parsed and displayed within the table element identified by `#sales-table`.

2. **Table Structure**  
   The table contains two columns:  
   - **Product**: The name of the product.  
   - **Sales**: The corresponding sales amount for the product.

3. **Total Sales**  
   The element with the id `#total-sales` automatically reflects the sum of all sales amounts from the CSV data, ensuring users always see an accurate total.

## Technical Details

- **Data Source:**  
  The sales data is sourced from a CSV file named `sales.csv`.

- **Table Generation:**  
  The application reads the CSV file, parses product and sales data, and dynamically creates a table with `#sales-table` containing a header row and data rows for each product.

- **Total Sales Calculation:**  
  Sales values are summed programmatically and the result is updated in the `#total-sales` HTML element to maintain accuracy whenever the data changes.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  - HTML5  
  - CSS3  
  - JavaScript (vanilla or with libraries such as PapaParse for CSV parsing if needed)  
  - Optional: Web server for serving files
