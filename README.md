# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Description

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a web application update that enhances the sales report by adding a dynamic table displaying each product alongside its corresponding sales amount from a CSV data source (`sales.csv`). The application ensures that the total sales amount shown in the element with the ID `#total-sales` remains accurate and up-to-date.

---

## Features

- Dynamically generates a sales report table with the ID `#sales-table`.
- Displays product names and their corresponding sales amounts.
- Includes a header row with columns: **Product** and **Sales**.
- Automatically calculates and updates the total sales figure in the `#total-sales` element.
- Reads sales data from an external CSV file (`sales.csv`).
- Ensures data integrity and proper formatting for easy readability.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
   - A local web server to serve static files (recommended for CSV file access).

2. **Project Files:**
   - `index.html` (or your main HTML file containing the sales report elements).
   - `sales.csv` (CSV file containing sales data).
   - JavaScript file(s) responsible for fetching and rendering the sales data.

3. **Running Locally:**
   - Place all project files in a single directory.
   - Start a local web server in that directory. For example, using Python 3:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

> **Note:** Accessing CSV files via `file://` protocol may be blocked by browsers due to security restrictions. Using a local server is recommended.

## Usage Guide

1. Ensure that your `sales.csv` file is properly formatted with two columns: `Product` and `Sales`. Example:

   ```csv
   Product,Sales
   Widget A,1500
   Widget B,2300
   Gadget C,500
   ```

2. Open the application in a web browser via the local server.

3. The application will load the CSV data, populate the table with ID `#sales-table`, and update the `#total-sales` element to reflect the sum of all sales.

4. To update sales data, modify the `sales.csv` file and refresh the page.

## Technical Details

- **Data Source:** Reads data from `sales.csv`, expected to be in CSV format with headers `Product` and `Sales`.
- **DOM Elements:**
  - `#sales-table`: A `<table>` element dynamically populated with sales data.
  - `#total-sales`: An element (e.g., `<span>`, `<div>`) that displays the total sales amount.
- **Data Handling:**
  - Parses CSV data using JavaScript (e.g., `fetch` API and string manipulation or a CSV parsing library).
  - Converts sales values to numbers and sums them to maintain the total sales.
- **Rounding:** Sales amounts are displayed as-is or rounded to nearest integer (based on implementation).
- **Compatibility:** Works in all modern browsers supporting ES6+ JavaScript features.
- **Extensibility:** Can be extended to support sorting, filtering, or visualization enhancements.
