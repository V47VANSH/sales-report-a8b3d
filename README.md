# sales-report-a8b3d

## Project Overview

**sales-report-a8b3d** is a simple single-page web application designed to process a CSV file named `sales.csv`. It reads the file, calculates the total sum of the values in the `sales` column, and displays the result dynamically on the page. The page title is set to **Sales Summary** to reflect its purpose clearly.

## Features

- Upload and parse a CSV file (`sales.csv`) directly in the browser
- Compute the total sum of the `sales` column accurately
- Display the total sales figure inside an HTML element with the ID `#total-sales`
- Minimalistic, user-friendly single-page interface
- No backend required â€” runs entirely on the client side

## Setup Instructions

No special setup or installation is required. This project is a static web page and can be run by simply opening the HTML file in a modern web browser.

## Usage Guide

2. Attach or upload your `sales.csv` file containing a `sales` column.
